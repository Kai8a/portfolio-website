          <p>
          My name is Kai Hasse an 18 year old web developer from South Africa currently based in Ã…land, Finland. in 2016 I originally started programming
          because I was interested in game developing so decided to take lessons in primary school, learning how to code with C# in Unity.
          In 2018 after going to High School I wanted to try something different so started looking at app development instead of game development, and taught myself
          how to code basic apps using Python. And then finally we come to 2022 when I decided to learn web development, and started working as a Jnr Dev for a company 
          called Kastelo.
